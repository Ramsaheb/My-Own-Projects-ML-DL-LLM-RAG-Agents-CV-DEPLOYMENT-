# 🤖 AutoAstra — Agentic AI Framework Project

AutoAstra is a **lightweight AI agent** built while exploring **Agentic AI frameworks** using **LLaMA, LangChain, and LangGraph**.  
It demonstrates how autonomous agents can plan, reason, and generate complete solutions from a simple user goal.

> Built as a practical experiment to understand how AI agents actually work internally.

## 🧠 What AutoAstra Does

You describe what you want to build, and the agent:
- Generates code  
- Builds logic and structure  
- Produces functional output  
- Follows scripted agent behavior  

The intelligence and behavior are defined directly inside the agent workflow, making it **fast, flexible, and modular**.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- LLaMA (Open-source LLM API)  
- LangChain  
- LangGraph  
- Agentic AI Architecture  

---

## 🧪 Example Tests

As a functional test, AutoAstra successfully built:
- A simple calculator  
- A task timer  

(Simple examples, but the framework supports much more advanced agents.)

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

- Learn how **agentic AI systems** work internally  
- Understand **tool calling, orchestration, and reasoning flows**  
- Build a strong foundation for more advanced autonomous agents
